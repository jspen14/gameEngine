# gameEngine
- You need to have a mysql program installed. MariaSQL was used in production. (Follow instructions here: https://github.com/zappala/cs260-examples/tree/master/node-sql)

- Open MYSQL on terminal then use commands:
  - "CREATE DATABASE gameEngine;"
  - "quit;"

- Once database is created, run migrations with command:
  - "npx knex migrate:latest"

- After migrations have been added, add matrices and AIusers with commands:
  - node data/addMatrices.js data/i1.json (then ctrl C to go back to main folder)
  - node data/addUsers.js (then ctrl c)

- Navigate to C++ folder (cd C++) and compile C++ client with commands:
  - g++ client.cpp -o client
  - Navigate back to main folder (cd ..)

- Install dependencies for node with command:
  - npm install
    - If it says that it didn't install all dependencies, do it manually with given instructions

- Start the server with commands:
  - source .env
  - node server.js (served on port 3000)

- Start the front end with command:
  - npm run dev (runs on port 8080)

- Add a C++ client (if desired) with commands:
  - cd C++ (to navigate into C++ folder)
  - ./client username
    - username can be Trump, Thumper, or Carnegie

(Preferred browser: Google Chrome)
